<p>The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are smartphones designed and marketed by Apple Inc. 
The devices are part of the iPhone series and were announced on September 9, 2014, 
and released on September 19, 2014.[17] The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus jointly serve 
as successors to the iPhone 5S and were themselves replaced as flagship devices of the 
iPhone series by the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus on September 9, 2015. The iPhone 6 and 
6 Plus include larger 4.7 and 5.5 inches (120 and 140 mm) displays, a faster processor, 
upgraded cameras, improved LTE and Wi-Fi connectivity and support for a near field 
communications-based mobile payments offering.[18][19]</p>

<p>The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus received positive reviews, with critics regarding their 
improved design, specifications, camera, and battery life as being improvements over 
previous iPhone models. However, aspects of the design of iPhone 6 were also panned, 
including plastic strips on the rear of the device for its antenna that disrupted the 
otherwise metal exterior, and the screen resolution of the standard-sized iPhone 6 being 
lower than other devices in its class. Pre-orders of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus 
exceeded four million within its first 24 hours of availabilityâ€”an Apple record.[20] 
More than ten million iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus devices were sold in the first three days, 
another Apple record.[21] During its lifespan, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus sold 220 million 
in total, making them the best selling iPhone models, so far, and one of the most successful 
phones to date.</p>

<p>Despite their positive reception, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus have been the subject of 
several hardware issues, including most prominently, being susceptible to bending under 
pressure (a design flaw nicknamed "Bendgate"), and as a byproduct of this lack of rigidity, 
the touchscreen's internal hardware being susceptible to losing its connection to the phone's 
logic board (nicknamed "Touch Disease"). The iPhone 6 Plus was also the subject of camera 
issues, including some devices with malfunctioning optical image stabilization or otherwise 
defects on rear cameras.</p>

<p>The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were moved to the midrange spot in Apple's iPhone lineup when the 
iPhone 6S and 6S Plus were released in September 2015. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were discontinued 
in most countries on September 7, 2016 when Apple announced the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. 
Their spot as the entry-level iPhone was replaced by the iPhone SE, which was released earlier 
on March 31, 2016. The iPhone 6 was relaunched with 32 GB of storage in Asian markets in February 
2017 as a midrange/budget iPhone. It was later expanded to Europe,[3][22] before hitting the US 
markets in May 2017,[23] and Canada in July 2017.[24]</p>

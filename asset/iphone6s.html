<p>The iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus (stylized and marketed as iPhone 6s and iPhone 
6s Plus) are smartphones designed, developed and marketed by Apple Inc. They were 
announced on September 9, 2015, at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco 
by Apple CEO Tim Cook, with pre-orders beginning September 12 and official release 
on September 25, 2015. The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus were succeeded by the iPhone 7 
and iPhone 7 Plus in September 2016.</p>

<p>The iPhone 6S has a similar design to the iPhone 6 but includes updated hardware, 
including a strengthened chassis and upgraded system-on-chip, a 12-megapixel camera, 
improved fingerprint recognition sensor, and LTE Advanced support. The iPhone 6S also 
introduces a new hardware feature known as "3D Touch", which enables pressure-sensitive 
touch inputs.</p>

<p>iPhone 6S had a mostly positive reception. While performance and camera quality were 
praised by most reviewers, the addition of 3D Touch was liked by one critic for the 
potential of entirely new interface interactions, but disliked by another critic for 
not providing users with an expected intuitive response before actually using the feature. 
The battery life was criticized, and one reviewer asserted that the phone's camera was not 
significantly better than the rest of the industry. The iPhone 6S set a new first-weekend 
sales record, selling 13 million models, up from 10 million for the iPhone 6 in the 
previous year. However, Apple saw its first-ever quarterly year-over-year decline in iPhone 
sales in the months after the launch, credited to a saturated smartphone market in Apple's 
biggest countries and a lack of iPhone purchases in developing countries.</p>

<p>The iPhone 5S is a smartphone that was designed and marketed by Apple Inc. Part of 
the iPhone series, the device was unveiled on September 10, 2013, at Apple's Cupertino 
headquarters. It was released on September 20, 2013, along with its lower-cost counterpart, 
the iPhone 5c.[14]</p>

<p>The iPhone 5S maintains almost the same external design as its predecessor, the iPhone 
5, although the 5S received a new white/gold color scheme in addition to white/silver and 
space gray/black, however the 5S has vastly upgraded internal hardware. The 5S introduced 
the A7 64-bit dual-core system-on-chip, the first 64-bit processor to be used on a smartphone, 
accompanied by the M7 "motion co-processor". A redesigned home button with Touch ID, a fingerprint 
recognition system which can be used to unlock the phone and authenticate App Store and 
iTunes Store purchases, was introduced. The camera was also updated with a larger aperture 
and a dual-LED flash optimized for different color temperatures.</p>

<p>The iPhone 5S was the first Apple device to ship with iOS 7, which introduced a revamped 
visual appearance and other new features. Designed by Jonathan Ive, iOS 7 departed from skeuomorphic 
elements used by previous versions of iOS in favor of a flat, colorful design. Among new 
software features introduced to the iPhone 5S were AirDrop, an ad-hoc Wi-Fi sharing platform; 
Control Center, a control panel containing a number of commonly used functions; and iTunes Radio, 
an internet radio service. Earphones known as EarPods were included with the 5S, and Apple released 
accessories including a case and a dock. The 5S is the third iPhone to support five major versions 
of iOS after the iPhone 4S and iPhone 5. The 5S supports iOS 7 up to version 11, being the oldest 
iPhone to support iOS 11 since it was the earliest to have incorporated a 64-bit SoC processor.</p>

<p>Reception towards the device was generally positive, with some outlets considering it to be the 
best smartphone available on the market due to its upgraded hardware, Touch ID, and other changes 
introduced by iOS 7.[15] Some criticized the iPhone 5S for keeping the design and small display of 
the iPhone 5,[16] and others expressed security concerns about the Touch ID system.[17] Nine million 
units of the iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C were sold on their weekend of release, breaking Apple's sales 
record for iPhones.[18] The iPhone 5S was the best selling phone on all major U.S. carriers in 
September 2013.[19]</p>

<p>The iPhone 5S was succeeded as Apple's flagship smartphone by the larger iPhone 6 in September 2014. 
On March 21, 2016, the 5S received a direct replacement with the announcement of the iPhone SE, which 
incorporated internal hardware similar to the iPhone 6S while retaining the smaller form factor and 
design of the 5S.[20]</p>
